I am a Masters student at [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in). I work as a research-assistant under [Dr. Saurabh Joshi](https://sbjoshi.github.io). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelors from Delhi University. 

My work focuses primarily in the fields of *Formal Methods* and *Program Verification*. I have been involved in the development of a verification tool [Pinaka](https://github.com/sbjoshi/Pinaka), which has been participating in an international verification competition [SVCOMP](https://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2020/) for the past 2 years. I am currently working towards verification of Golang concurrency primitives.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
