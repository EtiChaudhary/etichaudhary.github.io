**FC+** fact checks answers to factual questions in CQA Forums. This project was built on the original work done [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03178.pdf). The work involved increasing accuracy by changing learning algorithms and fine-tuning parameters. We also provided a different interpretation by making use of SVM-Rank on factually true answers. We also proposed 3 new sets of features for the dataset that lead to good accuracy gains.
